# File_Organizer_small
A mini project using Python, File Handling. It categorizes different files and makes different folder according to the specific types of file and lastly moved the files to the specific folders

Description: Here I have done a small project. Lets assume that I have folder. In that folder I have different types of files, like audio, video, text files etc etc. So I have written a python script that it checks all the files inside this folder and then categorizes all the files. Then it creates new specific directoris/ folders according to the files and moved the files to their respective folders.
